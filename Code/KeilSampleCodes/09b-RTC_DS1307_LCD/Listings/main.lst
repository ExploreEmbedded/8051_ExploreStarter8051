  11          The libraries have been tested on ExploreEmbedded development boards. We strongly believe that the
  12          library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. However, ExploreEmbedded
  13          disclaims any kind of hardware failure resulting out of usage of libraries, directly or indirectly.
  14          Files may be subject to change without prior notice. The revision history contains the information
